# Image-Caption-Generator-Flickr-
A deep learning project that generates natural language captions for images using the Flickr8k dataset. Built with CNN (InceptionV3) for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence modeling, the model learns to describe images in human-like sentences. Includes training pipeline, pre-processing scripts, and a simple Flask app for caption generation.
